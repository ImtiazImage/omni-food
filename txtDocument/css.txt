1) Cascading style sheets

2) Css defines exactly how html looks like

3) Html is content

4) CSS is style

5) Three ways to write CSS
 1) CSS code inside an HTML tag. For example: <p style="font-size: 120%">
 2) CSS code inside an HTML document wihtin head usually. For example: <style>p{font-size: 120%}</style>
 3) CSS code in external file.For example: p{font-size: 120%;}

6) Save as .css

7) link the external css file within the head. For example: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">

8) Css for text formatting: h1,h2{ color: green;font-size:40px;font-family:Helvetica Neue,Arial;}

9) text-align property is often use to format text

** 10) Child element inherits the property of its parents element unless we override.

11) Color in CSS:
 1) The RGB MODEL: #RRGGBB. For each color: MIN:0 and MAx:255. Hexadecimal code.

 2) Transparency with RGBA. Example: rgba(29,167,23,0.75) gives a green color with transperancy.

12) Selectors: Classes and Ids.
 1) attach them to elements. same class can be given to many element. But id can not be given
 2) for classes: use . then className.
 3) for Ids: use # then idName

** 13) THE BOX MODEL:
    1) Composed of Content: text,images etc (Most inner layer)-> also includes (width and height)
    2) Padding: transparent area around the content,
        inside of the box. (In between border and content)->
    3) Border: goes around the padding and the content ->
    4) Margin: space between boxes.(Most outer layer) ->
    **5) Be sure to use boz-sizing
    **6) Inline and block level element.
    **7) We can not define any height and weight for inline element.

14) First remove the default values by *{maring:0;padding:0;box-sizing:border-box}

15) Use div element to separate contents of your sites

16) Use left and right margin auto to center your content.

17) Focus on float property and clearfix:after{content:"";display:table;clear:both}

18) to select a specific image without giving another class. we will choose a parent class like .author-box img!!!!

** 19) Element positioning: Relative vs Absolute

So far all our elements are relativ. means position of your elements is determined by another elements
**Elements with absolute position can be placed anywhere inside their parent elements. Must ensure that
its parent element is Relatively positioned.
